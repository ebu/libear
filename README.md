*libear* is a C++11 library to render ADM content according to [Recommendation
ITU-R BS.2127](https://www.itu.int/rec/R-REC-BS.2127). It is not a complete
application, but provides components to calculate gains and apply them to
audio, for embedding into applications which need to render ADM content.

[Read the documentation](https://libear.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to get
started.

## Installation

### Dependencies

  - compiler with C++11 support
  - Boost header libraries (version 1.57 or later)
      - Boost.Optional
      - Boost.Variant
  - CMake build system (version 3.5 or later)

### Installation

To manually install the library you have to recursively clone the git
repository and then use the CMake build system to build and install it.

``` shell
git clone --recursive https://github.com/ebu/libear.git
cd libear
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make
make install
```

### Use from CMake Projects

As the library uses CMake as a build system it is really easy to set up
and use if your project does too. Assuming you have installed the
library, the following code shows a complete CMake example to compile a
program which uses the libear.

``` cmake
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.5)
project(libear_example VERSION 1.0.0 LANGUAGES CXX)

find_package(ear REQUIRED)

add_executable(example example.cpp)
target_link_libraries(example PRIVATE ear)
```

### Use as a Subproject

If you prefer not to install the library on your system you can also use
the library as a CMake subproject. Just add the folder containing the
repository to your project (for example, by using a git submodule) and
you can use the ear target:

``` cmake
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.5)
project(libear_example VERSION 1.0.0 LANGUAGES CXX)

add_subdirectory(submodules/libear)

add_executable(example example.cpp)
target_link_libraries(example PRIVATE ear)
```

Note that if `libear` is used as a CMake subproject the default values of the
options

  - `EAR_UNIT_TESTS`
  - `EAR_EXAMPLES`
  - `EAR_PACKAGE_AND_INSTALL`

are automatically set to `FALSE`.
